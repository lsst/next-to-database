Module that interfaces between pandas csv contertor and the actual csv file.

The module is used to handle csv files that associated with a scheme that
allows null integer or string values. These cannot be handled by pandas.
This module substitutes a known value for such values and adds set the
bollean value to true in the column used to indicate whether the value in
that column is null or not (see csv2pq_schema.py for details).
